Exploratory Data Assigment - Week 3
===================

This repo contains all the source code and the graphs aimed to answer several questions as a conseuqence of analyzing the  PM2.5 emission data and the Source Classification Code Table. Both are linked [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)


The question to be answered are the following:

* Question 1 - Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
** GUIDANCE: Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all 
sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.


* Question 2- Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland  (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
** GUIDANCE: Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

* Question 3- Of the four types of sources (type = point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) , which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City, Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008?
** GUIDANCE: Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question

* Question 4 - Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?
** GUIDANCE: no guidance provided

* Question 5 - How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City?
** GUIDANCE: no guidance provided

* Question 6 - Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips= '06037'). Which city has seen greater change over time?
** GUIDANCE: no guidance provided
